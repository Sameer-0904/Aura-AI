## 📝 Chat History

Aura AI now supports **chat history** 🗨️.  
The app automatically stores the **last 10 messages** in each session, so you can continue conversations with context.  

### Benefits:
- 🔄 Keeps track of ongoing discussions  
- 🧠 More natural and human-like interactions  
- ⏪ Lets you refer back to previous questions/answers  

> Currently, the history is stored in-memory (session-based). Future updates may include saving history to a database for long-term memory.
